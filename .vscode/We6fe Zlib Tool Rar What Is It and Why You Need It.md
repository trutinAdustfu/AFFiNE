## How to Compress Files with We6fe Zlib Tool Rar
 
To compress a file with We6fe Zlib Tool Rar, you need to use the `-c` option followed by the name of the file you want to compress. For example, if you want to compress a file called `example.txt`, you can type:
 `we6fe-zlib-tool-rar -c example.txt` 
This will create a compressed file called `example.txt.z` in the same directory as the original file. You can also specify a different name for the compressed file by using the `-o` option followed by the name of the output file. For example, if you want to name the compressed file `example.z`, you can type:
 
zlib compression ratio,  zlib vs gzip vs zip,  zlib download windows,  zlib example c++,  zlib decompress online,  winrar free download,  winrar vs 7zip performance,  winrar password remover,  winrar alternative mac,  winrar command line options,  7zip best compression settings,  7zip portable download,  7zip encryption strength,  7zip vs winzip vs rar,  7zip linux install,  lizard compression algorithm,  lizard vs lz4 vs zstd,  lizard python library,  lizard decompression speed,  lizard source code
 `we6fe-zlib-tool-rar -c example.txt -o example.z` 
You can also compress multiple files at once by using the `-m` option followed by the names of the files you want to compress. For example, if you want to compress three files called `file1.txt`, `file2.txt`, and `file3.txt`, you can type:
 `we6fe-zlib-tool-rar -m file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt` 
This will create three compressed files called `file1.txt.z`, `file2.txt.z`, and `file3.txt.z`. You can also specify a different name for each compressed file by using the `-o` option followed by the names of the output files separated by commas. For example, if you want to name the compressed files `f1.z`, `f2.z`, and `f3.z`, you can type:
 `we6fe-zlib-tool-rar -m file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt -o f1.z,f2.z,f3.z`
